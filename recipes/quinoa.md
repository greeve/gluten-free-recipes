# Quinoa

## Ingredients

- 1 cup quinoa, rinsed if necessary
- 2 cups liquid (water, chicken stock (I use chicken stock)
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Check the quinoa package to see if your quinoa needs rinsed. If it does, pour 1 cup of quinoa into a fine mesh strainer and rinse thoroughly with cold water.
2. Place quinoa, your liquid of choice, and salt into the rice cooker.
3. I use the quick cook setting on my Zojirushi Umami rice cooker, and then press the start button to starthe cooking process.
4. The rice cooker will beep after about 30 minutes, and your quinoa will be ready to serve.
5. For a standard rice cooker without all of the bells and whistles, one cooking cycle should be enough to do it. Note that you should let the quinoa set for about 4-5 minutes after itâ€™s done cooking and then fluff it.
