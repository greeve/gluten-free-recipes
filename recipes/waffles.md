Breakfast

# Waffles

## Ingredients

- 2½ c. gluten-free flour blend
- 1 Tbs. baking powder
- 3 Tbs. coconut sugar or maple syrup
- ¾ tsp. xanthan gum
- 2 eggs
- 3 Tbs. oil
- 2 c. milk (dairy or non-dairy)

## Instructions

1. Mix together the dry ingredients.
2. Make a "well" in the middle of the dry ingredients and add the remaining ingredients to the well.
3. Mix together until it is all combined.
4. Cook according to your waffle iron instructions.

## Notes

My waffles took about 4 minutes to cook, and I used ⅓-1/2 cup of batter per waffle, but your waffle iron may be different. A good guideline is to wait until the waffle stops steaming. I've found that gluten-free waffles take a little longer to cook than traditional waffles.
