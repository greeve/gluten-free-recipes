Dessert

## No Flour Monster Cookie Bars

### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup (1 stick) salted butter, softened
- 1/2 cup packed brown sugar (can substitute brown sugar with coconut palm sugar)
- 1 cup coconut palm sugar
- 1 1/2 cups creamy peanut butter (NOT all-natural)
- 3 large eggs
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 cups quick oats
- 3 cups old-fashioned oats
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 1/2 cups mini m&m's
- 1 cup miniature chocolate chips

### Instructions

1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Prepare a cookie sheet by lining with parchment paper, silpat liner, or spraying with cooking spray.
2. In a large bowl, or bowl of stand mixer with the paddle attachment, combine butter, brown sugar, palm sugar, and peanut butter. Mix until fluffy and pale in color. About 1-2 minutes.
3. Add the eggs and vanilla extract. Mix together.
4. Add in the oats and baking soda. Mix until combined.
5. Add in the m&m's and chocolate chips (reserve some for top of bars if wanted). Stir together with a wooden spoon or spatula until combined.
6. Dump dough onto the cookie sheet and spread out. This will take several minutes, but it can be done. It helps if you dollop spoonful's of dough all over the cookie sheet (rather than one pile in the middle) and then spread it out. Sprinkle the reserved m&m's and chocolate chips on top (if wanted). Press down slightly into dough.
7. Bake for 20 minutes. The edges will be lightly browned and the middle will still look pale and underdone, but it will finish baking as it cools. Let cool for at least an hour so the bars can firm up and come together. You do not want to over-bake these!
