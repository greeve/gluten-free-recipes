## Sugar Cookies

### Ingredients

#### Cookies

- 2 cups (280 g) all-purpose gluten-free flour (I like “Grandpa’s Kitchen”)
- 1 teaspoon xanthan gum (omit if your blend already contains it)
- 3/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar
- 3 tablespoons (22 g) confectioners’ sugar
- 8 tablespoons (112 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1 egg (50 g, weighed out of shell) at room temperature, beaten
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- A few teaspoons of water if dough is too thick

#### Frosting

- 10 tablespoons (140 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 4 tablespoons milk, at room temperature
- 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
- 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
- 2 teaspoons meringue powder (LorAnn brand is gluten free)
- 4 cups (460 g) confectioners’ sugar
- Sprinkles (optional)

### Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F. Line rimmed baking sheets with unbleached parchment paper and set them aside.
2. In a large bowl, place the flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, salt, granulated sugar and confectioners’ sugar and whisk to combine well. Add the butter, egg, and vanilla, and mix to combine. The dough will be thick and relatively stiff, and you may need to add a little water and squeeze it together with your hands to bring all of it together.
3. Roll the dough between two sheets of unbleached parchment paper into a round a bit less than 1/3-inch thick. Using a 2 1/2-inch round cookie cutter, cut out rounds of dough and place them about 1-inch apart on the prepared baking sheets.
4. Place the baking sheet in the center of the preheated oven and bake until just set, about 6 to 8 minutes, depending upon size. The edges of some of the cookies may brown slightly. Take them out before there is any significant browning. Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool until set. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
5. While the cookies are cooling, make the frosting. In the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, place the butter, milk and vanilla, and mix on medium speed until combined. Turn the speed up to high and mix until creamy. Add the salt, meringue powder and about 3 1/2 cups of confectioners’ sugar. Mix slowly until the sugar is incorporated. Turn the mixer up to high and beat until it becomes uniformly thick. Add the rest of the confectioners’ sugar if necessary to thicken the frosting.
6. Once the cookies are completely cool, pipe or spoon a generous amount of frosting onto the top of each, and spread into an even layer with a wide knife or offset spatula. Scatter sprinkles, if desired. Allow to set at room temperature until the frosting hardens a bit. Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature.
