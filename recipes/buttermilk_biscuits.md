## Buttermilk biscuits

### Ingredients

- 2 cups gluten-free flour blend (see notes)
- 1 teaspoon xanthan gum (omit if your flour blend contains it)
- 1 teaspoon (6 g) fine sea salt
- 1 tablespoon (12 g) baking powder
- ½ teaspoon (3 g) baking soda
- 6 tablespoons (87 g) unsalted butter, cubed and very cold
- ¾ cup (188 ml) buttermilk, cold + 1 tablespoon, divided

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees and grease a baking sheet or line it with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper.
2. Add the gluten-free flour, xanthan gum, salt, baking powder, and baking soda to a large bowl and whisk together.
3. Add the cubed butter and cut in with a pastry cutter or two forks until it resembles coarse crumbs.
4. Stir in ¾ cup buttermilk and mix until just combined.
5. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and pat into a rectangle. Fold the rectangle into 3rds and turn the dough a half turn. Then flatten into a rectangle until the dough is about a ½-¾ inch thick.
6. Cut the dough with a 2 ½ inch biscuit cutter and place the biscuits on the prepared baking sheet, the edges of the biscuits should be touching.
7. Re-roll the dough as needed (by stacking the scraps and flattening). If using a 2-inch biscuit cutter there will be about 12 biscuits total.
8. Refrigerate the biscuits at least 30 minutes to ensure that the butter stays nice and cold. This is especially important if your house/kitchen is warm and humid.
9. Brush the tops of the biscuits with the remaining 1 tablespoon of buttermilk then bake for 12-15 minutes or until the biscuits are browned and baked through.
