## Coconut chicken curry with potatoes and veggies

### Ingredients

- 4 boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces
- 1 cup of onions, sliced
- 1 white potato, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 5 cloves of garlic
- 1 can of Full Fat Coconut Milk
- 4 tablespoons of Curry Powder or Curry Paste
- 4 tablespoons of cooking oil/fat of choice (Olive oil, Butter, Coconut oil, Ghee, etc.) – Butter is my preference, but coconut also works well for this dish.
- Salt, as desired
- Optional: other vegetables: celery, carrots, peppers, etc..
- 1/2-1 cup chicken broth to thin it out

### Instructions

1. Cut your potatoes into small cubes.
2. Slice the onions.
3. Chop up the garlic.
4. Cut your chicken into small cubes.
5. In a large skillet on low heat add 2 tbsp of cooking fat/oil of choice.  
6. Once it melts and is hot enough, add the curry powder.  
7. Swirl it around until well blended.
8. Add in coconut milk. Mix well.
9. Add potatoes to the coconut curry blend, and bring to a boil and let simmer.
10. In a separate pan add 2 tbsp of cooking oil/fat of choice and sauté the garlic and the onions.
11. Once the onions are translucent, throw in the cubed chickens. Cook lightly, and remove from heat.
12. Add the meat, onion, and garlic mixture to the coconut curry blend.
13. Let it cook for about 30 minutes or when the potatoes and chicken are cooked thoroughly (and try not to die of hunger with all that delicious coconut milk aroma in the air!).
14. Add chicken broth if you like the curry thinner.
