Breakfast

## Granola Bars (chocolate chip)

Servings: 27 bars 

### Ingredients

- ½ cup coconut oil
- ¾ cup honey
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- 4 cups old fashioned oats
- 1 ½ cup brown rice crisp cereal
- ½ cup mini chocolate chips

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 13x9-inch baking dish with two pieces of parchment paper, perpendicular to each other. Let each piece of parchment overhang on two opposite sides of the pan.
2. Place coconut oil, honey and salt in a small saucepan. Heat over low heat, stirring, until the mixture comes to a low boil. Continue to let it bubble as you stir it for 1-2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla. Let the mixture cool for 2-3 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, stir together the oats and brown rice crisp cereal.
4. Pour the coconut oil and honey mixture over the oats and cereal in the bowl and stir until well combined. Stir in about 2/3 of the chocolate chips.
5. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish. Lay a piece of parchment across the top and use a rubber spatula and your hand to press it very firmly into the pan. Be sure to press the mixture down firmly to make sure that the bars will hold together when you cut them.
6. Sprinkle on the remaining chocolate chips and gently press them into the top of the bars.
7. Bake for 15 minutes. Let cool and then chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour before cutting into bars.
8. Store granola bars wrapped airtight in the refrigerator for 1-2 weeks (we never have any left after 1 week!) or the freezer for up to 3 months.
