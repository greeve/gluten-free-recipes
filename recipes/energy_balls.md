## Energy Balls

### Ingredients

- 1 cup (dry) oatmeal (Old Fashioned, gluten free)
- 1/2 cup peanut butter
- 1/2 cup ground flax seeds
- 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
- 1/3 cup honey or agave nectar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

### Instructions

1. Stir all ingredients together in a large bowl until combined. 
2. Once the mixture is combined, put it in the fridge for 10-20 minutes so that it will harden slightly.  This will help make it easier to roll it into balls.
3. Then once the mixture has cooled slightly, shape into 1” balls, and refrigerate in an airtight storage container.
