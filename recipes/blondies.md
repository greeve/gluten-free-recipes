Dessert

## Nutella Blondies

Serves: 18

### Ingredients

- Cooking spray or parchment paper
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, melted
- 1/4 cup brown sugar, packed (can substitute brown sugar for coconut palm sugar)
- 1/4 cup coconut palm sugar
- 1 egg, lightly beaten
- 1 teaspoon of vanilla
- 1 cup of gluten-free flour blend (I used my own but King Arthur's Multi-purpose or Bob's Red Mill 1 to 1 could work too)
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/8 teaspoon of baking soda
- Pinch of salt
- 1/2 cup Nutella, divided

### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F and spray an 8x8 brownie pan with cooking spray. (If doubling the batch use a 9x11) Whisk together the melted butter, sugar, egg and vanilla extract in a medium bowl.
2. Add the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Stir together until just incorporated and spread evenly into brownie pan. Dollop nutella in lines across the short end of the pan. Using a butter knife or spatula, spread evenly and then across the long way to make a wavy pattern.
3. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Allow to cool completely. Cut into squares and serve.
