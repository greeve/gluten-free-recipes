## Slow Cooker Black Beans

### Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups dried black beans, picked over, rinsed, soaked overnight and rinsed again
- 1 cup salsa (I used mild since I was serving it to children)
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 medium yellow onion, peeled and diced
- 1 1/2 cups bell pepper, deseeded and diced (optional)
- 1 tbsp ground cumin
- 1 tbsp dried oregano
- 1 tbsp garlic powder or to taste
- 4 cups water or broth
- 1-2 tbsp coconut oil or olive oil (optional, but it adds a richness to the beans many            enjoy)
- 1/2 tbsp salt  or to taste

### Instructions

1. Soak Beans the night before. Rinse before putting them in your crockpot.
2. Combine ingredients EXCEPT SALT in your slow cooker. You will add this after cooking.
Cover and cook on high for 3-4 hours (checking after 3 hours to see if the beans are done) or on low for 6-7 hours (checking after 6 hours to see if beans are done).
3. Once the beans are done cooking, remove the bay leaves. Stir in salt.
Enjoy warm! Use a slotted spoon to drain off extra liquid and serve beans over rice, quinoa or a salad. Top with avocado, extra salsa or shredded cheese.
4. If storing leftovers, allow beans to cool completely before transferring beans and some of the cooking liquid to an air-tight container. Store beans in fridge for up to 5 days or in freezer for up to a month.
