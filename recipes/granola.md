## Homemade Granola

### Ingredients

- 6 C. rolled oats
- 1/2 C. Maple syrup (or brown sugar)
- 1/4-1/2 C. sunflower seeds
- 2 C. raw almonds
- 1/2 C. Crasins
- 1 tsp. cinnamon
- Flaxseed 1/2 cup
- You can put in whatever you want!

### Instructions

1. Mix all ingredients except crasins. Stir in and coat thoroughly with:

- 1/3 C. Olive oil (or coconut)
- 1 tsp. vanilla
- 2/3-3/4 C. honey (the more honey, the more stuck together it will be, I use 3/4 C.) 

2. Spread mixture on greased cookie sheet or parchment paper-lined cookie sheet.  
3. Bake at 325 degrees for 23-24 minutes.  
4. Stir half way through or so for even color(I also add in the crasins halfway through so they are not so hard). 
5. After mixing, smash down with a spoon so granola is tightly packed. 
6. When done, do not mix, let set for chunky granola. If you want more separated granola, mix right away. Makes about 2 quarts.  
7. When cool, store in sealed container for 1-2 weeks at room temperature, longer in the refrigerator.
