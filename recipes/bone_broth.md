Dinner/Soups-Crockpot

## Bone Broth

### Ingredients

- 2 pounds (or more) of bones from a healthy source

#### Optional:

- 1 onion
- 2 carrots (roughly chopped and not peeled)
- 2 stalks of celery (roughly chopped)
- 2 tablespoons Apple Cider Vinegar
- 1 bunch of parsley
- 1 tablespoon or more of sea salt
- 1 teaspoon peppercorns
- Additional herbs or spices to taste
- Can also add 2 cloves of garlic for the last 30 minutes of cooking

### Instructions

1. Aim for 2 pounds of bones per gallon of water.
2. If you are using raw bones, especially beef bones, it improves flavor to roast them in the oven first. Place them in a roasting pan and roast for 30 minutes at 350.
3. Place the bones in a large crock pot. Pour (filtered) water over the bones and add the vinegar. Let sit for 20-30 minutes in the cool water. The acid helps make the nutrients in the bones more available.
4. Rough chop and add the vegetables (except the parsley and garlic, if using) to the pot. Add any salt, pepper, spices, or herbs, if using.
5. Let cook on low- 24 hours for chicken bones and 48 hours for beef.
6. During the first few hours of simmering, youâ€™ll need to remove the impurities that float to the surface. A frothy/foamy layer will form and it can be easily scooped off with a big spoon. Throw this part away. I typically check it every 20 minutes for the first 2 hours to remove this.
7. During the last 30 minutes, add the garlic and parsley, if using.
8. Remove from heat and let cool slightly. Strain using a fine metal strainer to remove all the bits of bone and vegetable.
9. When cool enough, store in a gallon size glass jar in the fridge for up to 5 days, or freeze for later use.
