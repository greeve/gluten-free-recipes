## Potato & Broccoli Medallions

### Ingredients

- 4 large russet potatoes
- 1 1/2 cup broccoli florets
- 2 tablespoons cream
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon white pepper
- 1 1/2 cups Swiss cheese, grated
- 2 green onions, finely chopped
- 1 egg

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375ºF. 
2. Line a large cookie sheet with parchment paper.
3. Peel and chop the potatoes into 1/2" chunks, drop into a medium-sized saucepan that has a tight fitting lid and has been filled with cold water. Set over medium-high heat, covered, bring up to a boil and simmer for 10-12 minutes, until fork tender. Remove potatoes from boiling water to a large mixing bowl to cool slightly.
4. Rinse out the potato pot, fill with cold water and broccoli florets. Cover and bring up to a boil, remove from heat and steam until fork tender, about 3-4 minutes. Drain broccoli and move to a cutting board, dice finely when cool enough to handle.
5. Meanwhile, pour the cream over the potatoes, season with salt and pepper. Coarsely mash the poateos with a potato masher. Stir in the broccoli, cheese, green onion, and egg. 
6. Place a 3" diameter biscuit cutter on the parchment-lined cookie sheet. Scoop a heaping tablespoon into the cutter and gently flatten with a spoon. Remove the cutter and continue with the mixture, until it is all gone.
7. Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown on top and bottom. Let cool slightly and serve. Excellent served with mayo seasoned with a bit of chipotle chili powder.
