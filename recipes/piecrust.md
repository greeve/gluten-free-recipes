# Pie Crust

## Ingredients

### One-Crust Pie (9 in.)

- 1 cup GF flour(with xanthum gum)
- 1/2 tsp. Salt
- 1/3 cup plus 1 Tbs shortening
- 2-3 Tbs cold water

### Two-Crust Pie (9 in.)

- 2 cups GF flour (with xanthum gum)
- 1 tsp. Salt
- 2/3 Cup plus 2 Tbs shortening
- 4-5 Tbs cold water

## Instructions

1. Mix flour and salt in a medium bowl. Cut in shortening, using pastry blender or crisscrossing 2 knives, until particles are size of small peas. Sprinkle with cold water, 1 Tbs at a time, tossing with fork until all the flour is moistened and pastry almost leaves the side of the bowl (1-2 tsp. Of water can be added if needed).
2. Gather pastry into a ball. Shape into flattened round on lightly floured surface. (For Two-crust pie, divide pastry in half and shape into 2 rounds.)You can wrap up dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate about 30 min to firm up the shortening slightly, which helps make the baked pastry more flaky. 
3. Roll pastry in lightly floured surface, using floured pin, into circle 2 inches larger than upside-down pie plate. Fold pastry into fourths and place in pie plate; or roll pastry loosely around rolling pin and transfer to pie plate. Unfold or unroll pastry and ease onto plate, pressing firmly against bottom and side and being careful not to stretch pastry
4. For one-crust: To prevent pie crust from becoming soggy, partially bake pastry before adding filling. Heat oven to 425. Carefully line pastry with a double thickness of aluminum foil, gently pressing foil to bottom and side of pastry. Let foil extend over edge to prevent excessive browning. Bake 10 min and then carefully remove foil. Fill the pie and bake as directed in pie recipe.
5. For two-crust: Fill pie crust and place 2nd crust over the top (adding butter before if recipe calls for it). You can do fun things for the edge or make a lattice by cutting 1/2in strips and weaving them on the top. Bake as directed on the pie recipe.
