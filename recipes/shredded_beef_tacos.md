# Shredded Beef Tacos

## Ingredients

- Roast of choice, I used a Chuck Roast and stripped the fat off the meat after cooked. I do this by hand so that I get it all. Sorry, not fun, but necessary. 
- Salsa
- 2 Tbs. Olive oil
- Salt and pepper
- Diced garlic (optional)
- Corn tortillas
- Garnishes of choice, cheese, avocado, lettuce, tomato, onion, plain greek yogurt pretending to be sour cream. 

## Instructions

1. Place defrosted roast in a large crock pot. Rub on olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic and add 1/2-1 cup of clean salsa over the top. Set the crock pot on low for 6-7 hours. 
2. Once finished, stir the roast to break it apart, strip off any fats, and mix the salsa together.
