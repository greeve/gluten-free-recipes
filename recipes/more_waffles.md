Breakfast

## More waffles

### Ingredients

- 1 3/4 cup GF flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon optional
- 1/4 cup of maple syrup or coconut sugar
- 3/4 cup dairy free milk, room temperature
- 5 tablespoons coconut oil (1/4 cup + 1 tablespoon)
- 2 eggs, room temperature
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

### Instructions

1. Whisk together the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl (chickpea flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt) until no lumps remain. 
2. In another bowl whisk together the milk, oil, vanilla and eggs.
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and mix with a spoon until just combined. The batter will be a little lumpy and that's fine. Let the batter rest for about 10 minutes.
4. While the batter is resting take this time to prep your waffle iron according to its individual settings. If your iron allows you to choose the temperature set it to medium-high. Grease your iron plates if needed.
5. When your ready, stir the batter once more and then scoop out 1/4 cup of batter and then pour onto the centre of your heated waffle iron. Close the lid and let cook until goldened and crispy.
6. Transfer the cooked waffles to a wire cooling rack to cool and rest as you finish cooking the rest of your waffles. Make sure you don't stack them on top of each other or they will lose their crispiness. 
7. Repeat with remaining batter and serve warm with your preferred toppings.
