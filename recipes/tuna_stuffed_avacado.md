## Ingredients

- 1 avocado, halved and pitted
- 1 (4.5 oz) cans tuna, drained

## Instructions

1. Scoop out some of the avocado from the pitted area to widen the "bowl" area. Place the scooped avocado into a medium-size mixing bowl. Mash it with a fork.
2. Add the tuna, bell pepper, jalapeno, and cilantro to the mixing bowl. Pour lime juice over. Stir it all together until everything is well mixed.
3. Scoop the tuna into the avocado bowls. Season with salt and pepper.
