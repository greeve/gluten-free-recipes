# Classic Deviled Eggs

## Ingredients

- 6 eggs
- 1/4 cup mayonnaise
- 1 teaspoon white vinegar
- 1 teaspoon yellow mustard
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Smoked Spanish paprika, for garnish
- Optional yolk mixture: curry powder, sweet relish or dill relish...

## Instructions

1. Place eggs in a single layer in a saucepan and cover with enough water that there's 1 1/2 inches of water above the eggs. 
2. Heat on high until water begins to boil, then cover, turn the heat to low, and cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat and leave covered for 14 minutes, then rinse under cold water continuously for 1 minute.
3. Crack egg shells and carefully peel under cool running water. Gently dry with paper towels. Slice the eggs in half lengthwise, removing yolks to a medium bowl, and placing the whites on a serving platter.
4. Mash the yolks into a fine crumble using a fork. Add mayonnaise, vinegar, mustard, salt, and pepper, and anything else and mix well.
5. Evenly disperse heaping teaspoons of the yolk mixture into the egg whites. Could use a plastic bag with the corner cut on the bottom to squeeze into the eggs. Sprinkle with paprika and serve.
