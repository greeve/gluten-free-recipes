# Chocolate Chip Cookies (perfect but more time)

## Ingredients

- 2 1/4 cups Bob's Red Mill 1-to-1 all purpose baking flour (blend should include xanthan gum)
- 1 tsp. baking soda
- 1 tsp. salt
- 2 ounces cream cheese, room temperature
- 3/4 cup butter, slightly melted
- 1 cup light brown sugar, packed
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
- 2 large egg yolks, room temperature
- 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Mix together flour, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl and set aside.
2. In your standing mixer using the paddle attachment, add cream cheese, melted butter, brown sugar and sugar. Mix on medium speed for 2 minutes.
3. Add vanilla extract and egg yolks to mixer and continue to mix on low speed until ingredients are well combined.
4. Slowly add the flour mixture to the wet mixture until all ingredients are well combined.
5. Fold in chocolate chips by hand.
6. Cover dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours (up to 4 days).
7. About 15 minutes prior to baking, remove dough from your fridge and set it on your counter to soften. This will make the dough easier to handle.
8. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
9. Line three cookie sheets with silicone liners or parchment paper.
10. Grab dough and roll into approximately 1 in. dough balls. Set on baking sheets and gently press down to slightly flatten.
11. You should have enough to make approximately 3 dozen cookies - 1 dozen per cookie sheet.
12. Bake first sheet of cookies for 11-12 minutes or until edges are slightly browned.
13. Remove from oven and allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5-10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
14. Continue to bake each sheet of cookies until all three dozen are cooked.
15. Enjoy!
