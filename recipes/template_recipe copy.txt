# Oatmeal muffins

## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups old-fashioned oats ( 1.5 cups ground, 1 cup whole)
- 2 Tbsp old-fashioned oats for muffin tops
- 2 bananas or 1 cup applesauce
- 2 large eggs lightly beaten (can work without the eggs) 
- 1/2 cup honey, maple syrup or brown sugar
- 1/4 cup natural peanut butter (optional - I don’t usually use it)
- 3/4 cup almond milk
- 2 tsp real vanilla
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- muffin tin

## Instructions

1. Mash bananas well, they should have no lumps. I use my mixer to mash them before adding the other wet ingredients.
2. Add eggs, honey, milk and vanilla. Mix to combine.
3. Add dry ingredients (including the ground oats and 1 cup whole oats) to wet ingredients and mix until just incorporated. Allow these to sit for 10 minutes to soak the oats.
4. Optional: Fold in approximately 1/2 c fruit, raisins or nuts.
5. Scoop into muffin tin, lined with muffin wrappers (makes 14 muffins).
6. Sprinkle muffin tops with the 2 Tbsp of reserved oats, press lightly to make sure they stick.
7. Bake at 350 for about 20 -23 minutes, a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin should come out clean.
8. Enjoy !
