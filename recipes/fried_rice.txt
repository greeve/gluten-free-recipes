# Fried Rice

## Ingredients

- 2 bags of boil-in-a-bag brown rice
- Veggies of choice
- coconut oil
- 1/4 cup of water
- ginger
- garlic
- red pepper flakes
- soy sauce
- salt
- pepper
- 3 chicken breasts
- eggs

## Instructions

1. Start with 2 bags of boil in a bag brown rice (I can't cook rice unless it's boil in a bag!) prepare that and drain the water.  
2. While your rice is cooking, grab some veggies, anything you have on hand! Broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus, carrots, green beans, sweet onion, peppers, really any combination of 3 or more veggies that you have on hand. Chop them up and sauté in 1 tsp of coconut oil and 1/4 cup of water with a dash of each: Ginger, garlic, red pepper flakes, soy sauce, sea salt and pepper.
3. Cut 3 chicken breast into bite size pieces and sauté in 1-2 tsp olive oil and the same spices as your veggies.
4. In a skillet, add some coconut oil and scramble eggs, I use 3-5. 
5. Push the eggs to the side and add your rice to the skillet. 
6. Fry your rice with about 2 tablespoons of soy sauce for about 3 minutes. 
7. Add veggies and chicken and mix well.
8. Enjoy!
