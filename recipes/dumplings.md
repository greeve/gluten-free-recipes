- 1 tsp grated fresh ginger
- 1/4 tsp sesame oil
- 1-2 cups cabbage mix

#### Wrappers

- 1/2 cup (63 g) Artisan Gluten-Free Flour Blend
- 1/2 cup (60 g) tapioca flour
- 1/2 cup (60 g) glutinous (sweet) rice flour
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tsp xanthan gum
- 1/2 cup boiling water
- 2 tbsp cold water
- 1 1/2 tbsp olive oil

#### Ponzu dipping sauce

- 1/4 cup tamari wheat-free soy sauce

### Instructions

1. Combine the filling ingredients in a small bowl and place in the refrigerator until ready to fill the wrappers.
2. Mix the three flours, salt, and xanthan gum, then add the boiling water and mix to combine. The mixture will be dry and crumbly.
3. Add the cold water and olive oil, mixing until a dough forms. Knead with your hands in the bowl to bring the bowl together, adding extra rice flour if the dough is sticky.
4. Divide the dough in half, and roll each half to form a thick snake. Cut each half into 12 pieces and cover with plastic wrap or put in a zip-top bag to prevent from drying out.
5. Roll each gum-ball-sized piece out between two pieces of plastic wrap, to form round wrappers 3 inches in diameter.
6. Place on a cookie sheet dusted with rice flour. Make only as many wrappers at a time as will fit in your steamer. For example, we made 8 dumplings per batch.
7. Heat a pot of water with your steamer on top. Cover the bottom of the steamer with a single layer of Napa cabbage leaves. Replace the cabbage leaves as needed.
8. For each dumpling wrapper, dust off any excess rice flour.
9. Place on a plate and put about 1 tbsp filling in the center of the wrapper.
10. Moisten the edge with water, and gather the dumpling at the top, squeezing to seal.
11. Repeat to complete the first batch.
12. Steam each batch of dumplings for 10 minutes.
13. While one batch is steaming, get started on the next batch. Repeat until all batches are done.
