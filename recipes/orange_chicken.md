## Orange Chicken

### Ingredients

- 1.25 pounds chicken breast fillets (about 3 breasts), cut into cubes
- 3/4 cup GF flour (with anthem gum)
- 3 tablespoons coconut oil
- 2 navel oranges
- 1/2 cup barbecue sauce
- 2 tablespoon lite soy sauce, optional tamari

### Instructions

1. In a gallon-sized ziplock bag, add chicken cubes and flour. Shake vigorously until chicken is well-coated. Remove chicken and shake off excess flour.
2. Add oil to a large skillet or wok, turn to medium heat, add cubed chicken and cook until lightly golden on all sides. Remove chicken and place on a paper towel. Drain any remaining oil from skillet.
3. Zest oranges and add to a mixing bowl. Squeeze juice from oranges, discard seeds, and add to the same bowl. Add barbecue and soy sauce and whisk to combine.
4. Add chicken and sauce mixture to the skillet. Toss to coat chicken. Cook on medium heat until sauce has thickened to desired consistency, about 10 minutes. Remove chicken with a slotted spoon and place on a platter.
5. Garnish with green onion slices, if desired. Add remaining sauce from the skillet to a bowl and serve along side chicken.
