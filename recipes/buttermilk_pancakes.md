## Buttermilk pancakes

### Ingredients

- 3 large eggs
- 1 cup milk
- 3/4 cup buttermilk
- 1/4 cup Maple syrup or sugar
- 1 tsp gluten free vanilla
- 2 cups gluten free flour (I used Bob's Red Mill 1:1)
- 1 T baking powder
- tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/3 cup butter, melted

### Instructions

1. In a medium-large bowl, whisk eggs until smooth.
2. Add milk, buttermilk, sugar, and vanilla and whisk.
3. Add flour (remember to stir, scoop, and level as mentioned in the blog post), baking powder, and baking soda. and stir or whisk just until combined. Batter will be a little thick.
4. Add melted butter and whisk just until combined.
5. Overmixing pancake batter can cause flat/tough pancakes, so only stir as much as you need to!
6. Preheat griddle between 300/325.
7. Pour batter onto griddle and cook until the tops are bubbly and bubbles start to pop. The bottoms should be a light golden brown.
8. Flip pancakes and cook for another 30 seconds or so, until the other side is a light golden brown and the pancake is set.
9. Serve pancakes with your favorite toppings. We love to enjoy these gluten free pancakes with homemade buttermilk syrup.
