# Cinnamon Sugar Donuts

## Ingredients

- 1 cup gluten-free flour blend
- 1/3 cup brown sugar, packed
- 1 teaspoon gluten-free baking powder
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon gluten-free vanilla
- 1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons avocado oil (or oil of choice)
- 1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons dairy-free milk
- 1 teaspoon white vinegar
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon

## Instructions

1. In a separate small mixing bowl, combine the sugar and cinnamon for the coating.
2. Preheat oven to 425Â°F. Grease one six-serving donut pan; set aside.
3. In a large mixing bowl, mix the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.
4. In a separate small mixing bowl, whisk the egg, vanilla, vegetable oil, dairy-free milk and vinegar.
5. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir until combined.
6. Spoon the batter into the prepared donut pan - filling each donut well about 2/3 full. The batter should not cover the center of the donut well where the hole will go.
7. Bake for 9-11 minutes or until the donuts rise and set.
Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes.
8. Place a wire rack over a cookie sheet or piece of parchment paper.
9. Carefully remove the donut from the pan. You may need to use a spoon or a rubber spatula to loosen them if they stick.
10. One at a time, dip the tops of your donuts into the coating, then flip them to coat the bottoms.
11. Place your cinnamon sugar donut on the rack and repeat until all donuts have been coated.
12. Store donuts in an airtight container at room temperate for up to three days.
