## Grilled Stuffed Mushrooms

### Ingredients

- 2 large Costco size containers of fresh mushrooms I used white
- 1 block of lite cream cheese
- 1 6 pack of Italian Sausage
- Grated Parmesan optional
- Salt & Pepper to taste

### Instructions

1. Prepare mushrooms by washing & breaking out the stems (Note....use the stems in pasta sauce or salad if you want).
2. Squeeze sausage out of casings & cook over medium high heat until browned and cooked through. I didn't drain mine because turkey sausage has little to drain. If using pork sausage, I would drain it. Add lite cream cheese and stir until melted.
3. Stuff mushrooms with cream cheese and sausage mixture. Sprinkle with parm, salt & pepper. Note that getting the parmesan to stick can be very fiddly (especially if you may have had a margarita before making these) so I skipped it after the first 3 or 4.
4. Preheat your bbq grill to around 375 go 400F. Place mushrooms on a griddle (we used our camping one) stuffing side up. Put in your bbq and close the lid. Keep an eye on them. The mushrooms are done when the tops are starting to brown and you can see a bit of liquid from the mushrooms. Don't over cook b/c they will get mushy.
