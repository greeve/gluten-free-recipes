## Ingredients

- 5-6 medium potatoes (enough for 4 cups when cut into ½ inch cubes), peeled if preferred
- ½ cup onion (about ½ of a medium onion), diced
- ½ cup green onion, chopped
- 3 cups milk (whole or 2%)
- 3 Tbsp butter
- 6 oz. bacon, chopped and cooked
- 2 tsp kosher salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 cup water
- Shredded cheese to top

## Instructions

1. Bring water and salt to a low boil
2. Add onions (both regular and green)
3. Cover and simmer for about 10-12 minutes.
4. Add remaining ingredients except for the bacon and SLOWLY bring to a boil.
5. Stir over low heat until potatoes are tender (should take about 15 – 20 minutes). Make sure to stir often using a wooden spoon so as not to scorch the milk on the bottom.
