# Red/Green Enchiladas

## Ingredients

- 16 corn tortillas
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 3 cups of red or green enchilada sauce
- 2 cups plus 1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese, divided. 
- 1 lb cooked chicken, diced
- salt and pepper to the taste
- 1 small can green chiles (if making green enchiladas)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Salt and pepper cooked chicken. 
3. Heat olive oil in a frying pan to med-high heat. Depending on how big your pan is, put one or two tortillas into the oil at a time. Cook until soft and then flip (about 30 sec on each side). Be careful not to cook too long. Place tortillas on a plate covered in paper towels to soak. 
4. Once tortillas have cooled, pour about 1 cup of your enchilada sauce in the bottom of a 9X12 pan. Place one tortilla in the pan, fill with chicken and cheese and then roll up. Continue doing this until the pan is full. 
5. Once pan is full of enchiladas, pour the rest of the sauce on top, then sprinkle remaining cheese and chiles if you are using them.
6. Cover pan with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Uncover and bake for 5-10 more minutes, until enchiladas are heated through and cheese is melted. Serve topped with additional chopped cilantro and Greek yogurt or sour cream.
