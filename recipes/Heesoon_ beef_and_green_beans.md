### Instructions

2. Put water and rice in rice cooker and cook on rice setting.
3. After rice has cooked for about 15 minutes or so, heat up 1 Tbs. oil on med-high heat in a frying pan. Add in the green beans with 1/8 cup of soy sauce, mix, mix, cover and let steam on med. heat for 5 min. Mix occasionally. 
4. While beans are cooking, heat 1 Tbs. Olive oil on another frying pan on med-high heat. Throw in the beef and marinade. Cook for just a couple minutes, mixing constantly. You don't want to overcook the meat.

6. Serve with warm sushi rice.
