## Crepes

Servings: 12

### Ingredients

2 eggs
1 cup almond milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup Bob's Red Mill brown rice flour (no xantham gum)
2 teaspoons coconut palm sugar (if you want them sweet)
1 tablespoon butter more for pan as needed


### Instructions

1. In a food processor, add the eggs, milk, and salt and process until blended.
2. With the motor on low, slowly add the flours, stopping occasionally to scare down the sides.
3. Add the sugar if using, omit if you are making savory crepes.
4. Heat 1 tablespoon butter in skillet over medium heat. Pour in batter by the half cupful into the hot pan. Tilt the pan to spread the batter evenly.
5. Cook the crepes, turning until slightly browned, about 3-4 minutes on each side.
6. Place crepes on waxed paper and sprinkle with a bit more flour to prevent them from sticking.
7. When the crepes are done, fill them right away or store them in the refrigerator or freezer to use later.
