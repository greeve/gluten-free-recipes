# Monster Cookies

## Ingredients

- 3 large eggs
- 1 1/2 cups Palm Coconut sugar (or brown sugar if you’d like)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup creamy peanut butter
- 4 Tbs. butter, softened
- 4 1/2 cups (18 ounces) gluten free old fashion oats (blend in blender a little)
- 1 cup (6 ounces) milk chocolate, semisweet, or bittersweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line cookie sheets with parchment paper, liners or lightly grease with cooking spray.
2. In a large mixing bowl with a handheld electric mixer (or in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment), add the eggs and sugar. Mix well.
3. Add the salt, baking soda, vanilla, peanut butter and butter. Mix until creamy and well combined, 1-2 minutes.
4. Stir in the oatmeal, and chocolate chips until combined. The dough will be sticky.
5. Scoop the dough into heaping tablespoon-sized balls (see note above) and place about 2 inches apart on the cookie sheets. If you want the cookies thinner, flatten them slightly with the palm of your hand.
6. Bake the cookies for 8-10 minutes. Don't overbake - the cookies should just be set and very lightly golden around the edges.
7. Let the cookies sit for 1-2 minutes on the cookie sheet before transferring to a cooling rack to cool completely. Store in a airtight container for 2 days (the baked cookies freeze well, also).
