Dinner/Soups-Crockpot

# Crock Pot Beef Stew

## Ingredients

- 1-1/2lbs stew meat, cut into bite sized pieces
- 1lb white potatoes (about 1 large potato,) peeled then chopped
- 8oz whole mushrooms, cut into quarters or sixths if large
- 2 carrots, chopped
- 2 ribs celery, chopped
- 1 onion, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 Tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 Tablespoon gluten-free Worcestershire sauce (I like Lea & Perrins)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
- 1 bay leaf
- 32oz gluten-free beef broth
- 1/4 cup gluten-free or corn starch
- 1/2 cup frozen peas

## Instructions

1. Add ingredients from stew meat to beef broth into a 6-quart crock pot then cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours, or until meat is tender (mine took 6 but it will depend on how big your stew meat is cut.) I added everything to the crock pot the night before then popped into the crock pot base in the morning and turned it on.
2. Add flour to a bowl then add a ladleful of cooking liquid and whisk until smooth. Pour back into crock pot then stir well to combine and cook on high for 30-45 more minutes, or until broth has thickened (Note: broth will continue to thicken while cooling.) Add peas then let sit until heated through, 5 minutes, before serving.
