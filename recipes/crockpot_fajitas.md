### Instructions

1. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil in the bottom of your crock pot and 2 teaspoons of real butter.
2. Layer the chopped peppers first, I used orange and red but whichever colors you prefer. Then add sliced onions on top.
3. Add chicken next, setting it right on top of the peppers/onion. I used 3 breasts to serve 4.
4. Season the chicken with Fajita seasoning (chili powder, ground cumin, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, salt, pepper)
5. Add 1/3 cup of clean salsa right on top of the chicken. 
6. Set the slow cooker to low and cook for 5 hours for defrosted chicken, 7 for frozen chicken. 
7. Stir chicken to I guess I'll get there shred it and then use whole wheat (or your favorite) tortillas, cheese, plain greek yogurt masquerading as sour cream, avocado, tomatoes, etc as garnish! Seriously YUM.
