# Taquitos

## Ingredients

- 1 lb. cooked shredded chicken
- salt and pepper
- other seasonings if you'd like (seasoning salt or garlic powder)
- 12 corn tortillas or more
- toothpicks

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. 
2. Add salt and pepper (and other seasonings) to shredded chicken, cook tortillas in oil in a frying pan to soften (they should not be crispy). 
3. Let cool on paper towels, roll chicken in tortillas, hold with toothpicks and lay taquitos in a lined parchment paper cookie sheet. 
4. Cook for 30 min. Or until light brown. Serve with guacamole and salsa. Tastes great with sprinkled cheese on top.
