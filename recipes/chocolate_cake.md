## Chocolate Cake 

### Ingredients 

- 1 cup (80g) unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 cup hot water (240 ml)
- 2 cups sugar (400g)
- 1 ¾ cup (210g) all-purpose gluten-free flour blend (see notes)
- 1-3/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 1-1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup greek yogurt (240 ml)
- ½ cup vegetable oil (120 ml)
- 2 tsp vanilla extract

### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°. Line the bottom of two 8-inch cake pans with parchment paper, then grease the sides. 
2. In a medium bowl, whisk the hot water (or coffee) and cocoa together until smooth. Set aside.
3. In a large mixing bowl, add the sugar, gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Using a whisk, blend and sift the ingredients together.
4. Add the eggs, yogurt, oil, vanilla, and the cocoa mixture to the dry ingredients. Mix with a whisk or an electric mixer until all the ingredients are very well blended and look smooth.
5. Pour the batter into the two prepared pans and place in the center of the preheated oven. Bake for 33 to 37 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean.
6. Let cool in the cake pans for 5 to 10 minutes then run a knife around the edge of the pans to loosen the cake from the pans. Invert the cakes onto a cooling rack and remove the parchment paper.
7. While the cakes are cooling, make the frosting (see the recipe below). Make sure the cakes are completely cooled before covering them with frosting. Warm cakes will melt the frosting. Partially freezing the cakes will make it easier to frost them.
