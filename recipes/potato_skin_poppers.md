# Potato Skin Poppers

## Ingredients

- 1 bag (28 ounces) baby yukon potatoes
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon smoked paprika, divided
- pinch of big crystal salt
- ½ cup cheddar cheese
- ¼ cup plain non fat Greek yogurt

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees; line baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Arrange potatoes on baking sheet and poke several holes into potatoes with a knife.
3. Massage oil and ½ tablespoon smoked paprika onto the potatoes, and sprinkle with salt; bake for 40 minutes.
4. Remove from oven when potatoes are fork tender and allow to cool until easy to touch.
5. Slice potatoes in half and scoop out most of the potato flesh, leaving a thin layer close to the skin and set aside. {You can use the creamy flesh to make mashed potatoes.}
