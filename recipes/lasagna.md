### Ingredients

- 2.5 lb. ground turkey 
- 1 1/2 cups minced yellow onion 
- 1/2 tsp salt (to turkey when cooking)
 - 1/2 tsp pepper (to turkey when cooking) 
- 3 cloves of garlic, minced 
- 1 cans (14.5 ounce) petite diced tomatoes
- 2 cans (6 ounce) tomato paste
 - 2 Tablespoons Dried parsley
 - 2 Tablespoons Dried Basil
 - 1/2 tsp. salt (to sauce) 
- 3 cups low fat cottage cheese
 - 2 whole beaten eggs 
- 1/2 cups shredded Parmesan cheese
 - 2 wTablespoons Dried parsley (to cottage cheese mixture)
 - 1/2 tsp salt (to cottage cheese mixture) 
- 1 lb. mozzarella cheese ( or blend of mozzarella cheese)
 - 11 lasagna noodles 
- (add 1/2 tsp. salt and 1 Tablespoon of olive oil to pasta water) 

### Instructions 

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
 2. Meanwhile, in a large oiled skillet or saucepan, sauté the onions. When onions are clear combine ground turkey, salt, pepper, and garlic. Cook over medium-high heat until browned. Drain half the fat. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil and salt. After adding the tomatoes, the sauce mixture should simmer for 45 minutes while you are working on the other steps.
 3. In a medium bowl, mix cottage cheese, beaten eggs, shredded Parmesan, 2 more tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir together well. Set aside. Cook lasagna until “al dente” (not overly cooked). 
4. To assemble:  Arrange 4 cooked lasagna noodles in the bottom of a baking pan, overlapping if necessary. Spoon half the cottage cheese mixture over the noodles. Spread evenly. Cover cottage cheese with a layer of mozzarella cheese. Spoon a little less than half the meat/sauce mixture over the top.  Repeat, ending with meat/sauce mixture. Sprinkle top generously with extra Parmesan. Either freeze, refrigerate for up to two days, or bake immediately: 350-degree oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until top is hot and bubbly.
