Dinner/Soups-Crockpot

## Chicken Noodle Soup

### Ingredients

 - 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts 
- 1 yellow onion
 - 2 cloves of garlic
 - 3-4 medium carrots 
- 3 celery ribs
 - 2 quarts of chicken stock (I make my own, but you can buy it in the store) 
- dried thyme 
- 1 bay leaf 
- Gluten free egg Noodles or brown rice noodles
 - kosher salt and fresh ground pepper

### Instructions

1. Chop all of your veggies and set aside.
2. In a medium-large soup pot submerge your raw chicken in the chicken stock and boil until cooked.
3. Pull cooked chicken and set aside, add all of your chopped veggies and egg noodles to your pot. Add your bay leaf, thyme and salt and pepper. Cook for 4-5 minutes.
4. Chop or shred your chicken (whatever you prefer) and add back into the pot for an additional 2 minutes.
5. Your veggies will still have a little bite to them, your noodles will be perfectly cooked, and your chicken will be flavorful and delicious. Serve with a crusty fresh baguette and enjoy!
