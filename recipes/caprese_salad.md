## Caprese Salad

### Ingredients

- 2½ cups lightly packed fresh basil leaves rough chopped
- 1½ teaspoons kosher salt
- ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 6 slices fresh Mozzarella cheese whole-milk
- 6 slices summer tomatoes
- Flake sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to season
- Fresh basil leaves for garnish

## Instructions

1. Place the basil and kosher salt in the bowl of a food processor and push the process button. While the basil is processing, slowly add the olive oil and continue processing until the basil/oil/salt mixture looks like a thin pesto sauce.
2. Slice the mozzarella into 6 (1/4”) slices and slice the tomatoes into 6 (1/4”) slices.
3. Alternate the cheese and tomato slices on a plate and drizzle with the basil-oil. Season lightly with flaked sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Garnish with fresh basil leaves. Refrigerate, lightly covered, up to 1 hour or serve immediately.
4. Enjoy!
