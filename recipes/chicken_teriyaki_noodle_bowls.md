# Chicken Teriyaki Noodle Bowls

## Ingredients

- 15 ounces rice long Noodles
- 1/3 cup soy sauce, low sodium
- 1/4 cup honey
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 tablespoon ginger root, fresh
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 pound chicken thigh, boneless, skinless
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 cup broccoli, florets
- 1 cup chopped carrot
- 1 cup bell pepper, red
- 1 cup snow peas
- 1 cup cabbage

## Instructions 

1. Boil a pot of about 5 cups of water and add your refrigerated soba or udon noodles to the water. It will take only 2 minutes for the noodles to separate, then drain and set aside.
2. In a small sauce pan over medium heat, combine soy sauce, honey, garlic and ginger.
3. In a small bowl combine corn starch and 1/4 cup of water and whisk until smooth. Add to sauce pan and stir until combine. Cook until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, then remove from heat.
4. Chop up chicken thighs into 1 inch pieces. Add to a large pan over medium heat with olive oil. I spooned in some of the sauce to cook some of the flavor into the chicken. Let the chicken brown on each side for just a few minutes (2 is enough) and then add veggies. I chopped mine all up in similar sized pieces and added them in the listed order. Cover the pot if you want to help the veggies steam to cook.
5. Let cook for 3-4 minutes stirring occasionally and then add the rest of the sauce and the noodles and stir. Let cook for 2 minutes and then serve!
