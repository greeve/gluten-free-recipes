# Breads

## Blender Zucchini Bread

### Ingredients

- 1 cup neutral oil such as avocado or canola
- 3 large eggs
- 1 T vanilla extract
- About 3 cups largely chopped zucchini
- 2 cups sugar
- 3 cups flour mix
- 2 tsp Xanthan Gum (omit if flour mix already contains xanthan)
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp Baking Powder
- 2 tsp Baking Soda
- 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon

#### Chocolate Zucchini Bread

- 2-4 T cocoa powder
- 1 1/2 cups mini chocolate chips

3. Spray loaf pans (8 mini or 2 regular, or any combination) fairly heavily with cooking spray, or grease generously with oil.
4. Pour batter into pans.
5. Preheat oven to 350 (letting batter sit while you preheat oven eliminates any gritty texture).
6. Bake large loaves for 35-40 minutes, mini loaves 17-22 minutes, until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Be careful not to over bake, as they could become dry.
7. Let cool in pans for 10 minutes before removing to cooling rack.
8. Store in plastic bags in fridge up to 7 days, counter up to 4. or wrap in foil and place in freezer bag and freeze. Thaw at room temperature, in the fridge, or in 325 degree oven until warm.

## Waffles-best gluten free yet

### Ingredients

- 1 3/4 cup GF flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon optional
- 1/4 cup of maple syrup or coconut sugar
- 3/4 cup dairy free milk, room temperature
- 5 tablespoons coconut oil (1/4 cup + 1 tablespoon)
- 2 eggs, room temperature
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

### Instructions

1. Whisk together the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl (chickpea flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt) until no lumps remain. 
2. In another bowl whisk together the milk, oil, vanilla and eggs.
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and mix with a spoon until just combined. The batter will be a little lumpy and that's fine. Let the batter rest for about 10 minutes.
4. While the batter is resting take this time to prep your waffle iron according to its individual settings. If your iron allows you to choose the temperature set it to medium-high. Grease your iron plates if needed.
5. When your ready, stir the batter once more and then scoop out 1/4 cup of batter and then pour onto the centre of your heated waffle iron. Close the lid and let cook until goldened and crispy.
6. Transfer the cooked waffles to a wire cooling rack to cool and rest as you finish cooking the rest of your waffles. Make sure you don't stack them on top of each other or they will lose their crispiness. 
7. Repeat with remaining batter and serve warm with your preferred toppings. 

### Notes

- Make it dairy/nut free: You can use any milk of your choice here (dairy free or not)
- Make it egg free: You can actually leave out the eggs altogether here. I found that these came out crispier without eggs but you do need to be a little more gentle with removing the cooked waffles from the iron and make sure you grease the iron well. 
- Freeze it: Allow the waffles to cool completely then wrap up/seal in a freezer safe bag. You can just pop these in a toaster to heat through when you're ready.
- Instead of chickpea flour you can also use regular gluten free all purpose flour or certified gluten free oat flour.

## Veggie omelets

### Ingredients

- 1/2 Tbsp. butter
- 2 Tbsp. onion chopped
- 1/4 c. mushrooms chopped
- 1/2 c. fresh spinach
- 3 cherry tomatoes sliced in half
- shredded cheddar cheese to taste
- 2 eggs
- 2 Tbsp. vegetable or canola oil
- 2 Tbsp. water or milk
- salt and pepper to taste
- avocado (optional)
- salsa (optional)
- guacamole (optional)

### Instructions

1. Prepare your fillings. Heat butter in a small frying pan over medium heat. Add onions and mushrooms and saute until onions become clear. Add spinach and tomatoes. When spinach has wilted, remove from heat and cover with lid or foil to keep warm.
2. Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl and whisk until eggs become light yellow in color. Set aside. Pour oil into In an 8" pan (you don't want to do a smaller pan or the eggs won't cook as well) and swirl around until pan in evenly coated with oil. Put pan on the stove over medium-low heat.
3. While oil is heating quickly add water, salt, and pepper to the eggs and beat vigorously until the eggs become light and airy. When the oil becomes wavy and hot, slowly pour the eggs into the pan. Once the eggs are in the pan, do not stir! Let them just sit and start to bubble up a little bit.
4. When the bottom of the eggs begin to set a little bit, use heat-resistant rubber spatula to gently push one edge of the egg into the center of the pan, while tilting the pan to allow the still liquid egg to flow in underneath. Repeat with the other edges, until there's no liquid left.
5. Your eggs should now resemble a bright yellow pancake, which should easily slide around on the nonstick surface. If it sticks at all, loosen it with your spatula.
6. Now gently flip the egg pancake over, using your spatula to ease it over if necessary. Cook for another few seconds, or until there is no uncooked egg left. DO NOT OVERCOOK!
7. Stir cheese and toppings together and spoon down center of the omelet in a line (adding more cheese to the top if you like it extra cheesy). Quickly fold one side of the omelet over the toppings and then do the same with the other side (as if you were folding a piece of paper into thirds).. you may also just fold the omelet straight over (as if folding a piece of paper in half). You may keep the omelet in the pan until the cheese is melted (flipping over if necessary).. just be sure you don't overcook the eggs-- you don't want them to be crispy and brown!
8. Top with additional toppings, hollandaise sauce (click here), salsa, sour cream.. etc...

\newpage

## Apple Cider Donuts

### Ingredients

#### Donuts

- 1 1/2 cups (210 g) all purpose gluten free flour (I used Better Batter)
- 1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum (omit if your blend already contains it)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- 3/4 cup (150 g) granulated sugar
- 6 tablespoons (84 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 2 eggs (100 g, weighed out of shell) at room temperature, beaten
- 3/4 cup (6 fluid ounces) apple cider

#### Topping

- 1/3 cup (67 g) granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

### Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 325°F. Grease a standard donut pan and set it aside. See the post for a discussion of donut pans.
2. In a large bowl, place the flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cream of tartar, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, nutmeg, and 3/4 cup granulated sugar, and whisk to combine well. Create a well in the center of the flour mixture, and add the butter, eggs, and cider, and mix to combine. The batter will be very soft.
3. Transfer the batter to a piping bag fitted with a plain tip or to a squeeze bottle. Squeeze the batter into the prepared doughnut wells until they are each about 3/4 of the way full. Shake the pan back and forth horizontally until the batter is in an even layer in each well. Place in the center of the preheated oven and bake until the tops of the donuts spring back when pressed gently (about 12 minutes). The underside will be browned, but the tops will still be relatively pale. Remove the pan from the oven and allow the donuts to cool for about 3 minutes, or until they are no longer too hot to touch.
4. While the donuts cool slightly, place the cinnamon sugar topping ingredients into a small bowl. Gently remove the slightly cooled (but still warm) donuts from the doughnut pan with your fingertips and turn them around in the cinnamon sugar until they are well-coated on all sides. Place the finished donuts on a clean sheet of parchment paper. Serve immediately, or at least within a day or two stored uncovered at room temperature. Freeze any remaining leftovers in a sealed, freezer-safe container.

## Vanilla Cake Donuts

Prep time: 10 minutes

Cook time: >12 minutes

Yield: 12 standard-size donuts

### Ingredients

#### Donuts

- 1 1/2 cups (210 g) all purpose gluten free flour (I used Better Batter)
- 3/4 teaspoon xanthan gum (omit if your blend already contains it)
- 1/4 cup (36 g) cornstarch
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- 3/4 cup (150 g) granulated sugar
- 8 tablespoons (112 g) unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- 2 eggs (100 g, weighed out of shell) at room temperature, beaten
- 3/4 cup (193 g) plain yogurt, at room temperature
- 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste (or 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract)

#### Glaze (optional)

- 1 cup (115 g) confectioners’ sugar
- 2 to 4 teaspoons milk or buttermilk

#### Sugar coating (optional)

- 4 tablespoons (56 g) unsalted butter, melted
- 1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar

### Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F. Grease a standard-size donut pan and set it aside.
2. In a large bowl, place the flour, xanthan gum, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda, kosher salt, nutmeg, and sugar, and whisk to combine well. Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients, add the butter, eggs, yogurt, and vanilla, and mix until just combined. Fill the prepared wells of the donut pan until nearly full. For perfectly shaped donuts, place the donut batter into a piping bag fitted with a large, open tip, and pipe the batter into the wells. Wet the pointer finger of your dominant hand and run it along the center of each well of the donut pan to force the batter toward the perimeter of each well. This will help the donut hole from closing during baking.
3. Place in the center of the preheated oven and bake for about 12 minutes or until the donuts are set and just lightly browned. Remove from the oven, and allow the donuts to cool in the pan for 5 minutes.
4. If you’re planning to use the optional glaze, transfer the donuts to a wire rack to cool completely. In a small bowl, place the confectioners’ sugar and 2 teaspoons of milk, and mix well. Add more milk by the half-teaspoon until you have a smooth but thickly pourable glaze. Working quickly, dip the top of each cooled donut in the glaze, turn back and forth a bit to coat well, invert the donut so the glaze is facing upward, and place on a flat surface to set.
5. If you’re using the optional sugar-coating, invert the donuts onto a wire rack while they’re still warm. Dip each donut carefully in the melted butter and then press into the granulated sugar before replacing on the wire rack. The sugar coating will harden as it cools.

## Cinnamon Rolls

### Ingredients

#### Dough

- ⅔ cup milk
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 packet (7 g) yeast
- ¼ cup granulated sugar
- ½ cup (83 g) potato starch
- 3/4 cup (80 g) brown rice flour (or Gluten Free Flour recipe)
- ¼ cup (34 g) tapioca starch plus more for flouring your surface
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1½ teaspoon xantham gum
- 2½ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 large egg
- ¼ cup olive oil
- ½ teaspoon vanilla
- good quality plastic wrap for rolling out (and up!) the dough

#### Filling

- ⅓ cup butter, softened
- ½ cup brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon cinnamon

#### Frosting

- 3 tablespoons butter, softened
- 2 tablespoons cream cheese, softened
- ¾ cup powdered sugar
- ½ teaspoon vanilla
- dash of salt

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and lightly flour a pie plate.

#### Dough

1. Combine yeast and sugar in large mixing bowl.
2. Microwave milk and 1 tablespoon butter to approximately 110-115 degrees.Whisk into yeast mixture and set aside to proof.
3. Meanwhile in small bowl whisk together potato starch, brown rice flour, tapioca starch, baking soda, xanthan gum, baking powder, and ½ teaspoon salt.
4. Once yeast is proofed add in egg, oil, and ½ teaspoon vanilla. Mix for a moment and then slowly add in the flour mixture. Turn the mixer up to medium-high and beat for 1½ minutes - beating long enough is essential, GF flours are "thirsty," the dough will thicken & lose it's stickiness as you beat it.
5. Roll out the dough: this is a sticky dough that you'll want to roll out to approximately a 13" x 10" rectangle. What I have found works best is covering my work surface with a good quality plastic wrap and then a light layer of tapioca starch. I place my dough in the center and cover with a bit more tapioca starch and another sheet (or two) of plastic wrap. Roll out to the needed size and then carefully peel off the top layer of plastic wrap.
6. Using a knife or spatula gently spread the ⅓ cup softened butter over the dough evenly leaving ½" space around the edges.

#### Filling

1. In a small bowl combine brown sugar & cinnamon. Sprinkle evenly over dough.
2. To roll your dough: start on one of the shorter sides and gently begin rolling your dough into a log form. Use the plastic wrap to help you "lift and roll" the dough as you go along. Try to make it a nice tight roll, however do not try to unroll it and re-do it. You'll end up with a sticky mess.
3. Sprinkle lightly with tapioca starch again. Dip a sharp knife into tapioca starch then cut the rolls into 8 pieces.
4. Place the rolls, cut side down, in the prepared pie plate. Cover with plastic wrap and a towel, place in a warm spot, and let them rise for 15 minutes.
5. Bake 14-16 minutes until tops are golden brown.

#### Icing

1. Meanwhile, in mixing bowl, beat 3 tablespoons softened butter, cream cheese, and powdered sugar until smooth. Beat in vanilla and a dash of salt.
2. Drizzle over the tops of cinnamon rolls as soon as they come out of the oven.

### Notes

Night before preparation: Once the rolls are in the pie plate, cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge. In the morning set them out for at least 25 minutes before baking.

## More waffles

### Ingredients

- 1 3/4 cup GF flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon optional
- 1/4 cup of maple syrup or coconut sugar
- 3/4 cup dairy free milk, room temperature
- 5 tablespoons coconut oil (1/4 cup + 1 tablespoon)
- 2 eggs, room temperature
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

### Instructions

1. Whisk together the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl (chickpea flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt) until no lumps remain. 
2. In another bowl whisk together the milk, oil, vanilla and eggs.
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and mix with a spoon until just combined. The batter will be a little lumpy and that's fine. Let the batter rest for about 10 minutes.
4. While the batter is resting take this time to prep your waffle iron according to its individual settings. If your iron allows you to choose the temperature set it to medium-high. Grease your iron plates if needed.
5. When your ready, stir the batter once more and then scoop out 1/4 cup of batter and then pour onto the centre of your heated waffle iron. Close the lid and let cook until goldened and crispy.
6. Transfer the cooked waffles to a wire cooling rack to cool and rest as you finish cooking the rest of your waffles. Make sure you don't stack them on top of each other or they will lose their crispiness. 
7. Repeat with remaining batter and serve warm with your preferred toppings.

## Waffles

### Ingredients

- 2½ c. gluten-free flour blend
- 1 Tbs. baking powder
- 3 Tbs. coconut sugar or maple syrup
- ¾ tsp. xanthan gum
- 2 eggs
- 3 Tbs. oil
- 2 c. milk (dairy or non-dairy)

### Instructions

1. Mix together the dry ingredients.
2. Make a "well" in the middle of the dry ingredients and add the remaining ingredients to the well.
3. Mix together until it is all combined.
4. Cook according to your waffle iron instructions.

### Notes

My waffles took about 4 minutes to cook, and I used ⅓-1/2 cup of batter per waffle, but your waffle iron may be different. A good guideline is to wait until the waffle stops steaming. I've found that gluten-free waffles take a little longer to cook than traditional waffles.

## Roasted Potatoes

### Ingredients

- Kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon (4g) baking soda
- 4 pounds (about 2kg) russet or Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into quarters, sixths, or eighths, depending on size (see note)
- 5 tablespoons (75ml) extra-virgin olive oil, duck fat, goose fat, or beef fat
- Small handful picked rosemary leaves, finely chopped
- 3 medium cloves garlic, minced
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Small handful fresh parsley leaves, minced## Instructions 

### Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450°F/230°C (or 400°F/200°C if using convection). Heat 2 quarts (2L) water in a large pot over high heat until boiling. Add 2 tablespoons kosher salt (about 1 ounce; 25g), baking soda, and potatoes and stir. Return to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until a knife meets little resistance when inserted into a potato chunk, about 10 minutes after returning to a boil.
2. Meanwhile, combine olive oil, duck fat, or beef fat with rosemary, garlic, and a few grinds of black pepper in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat. Cook, stirring and shaking pan constantly, until garlic just begins to turn golden, about 3 minutes. Immediately strain oil through a fine-mesh strainer set in a large bowl. Set garlic/rosemary mixture aside and reserve separately.
3. When potatoes are cooked, drain carefully and let them rest in the pot for about 30 seconds to allow excess moisture to evaporate. Transfer to bowl with infused oil, season to taste with a little more salt and pepper, and toss to coat, shaking bowl roughly, until a thick layer of mashed potato–like paste has built up on the potato chunks.
4. Transfer potatoes to a large rimmed baking sheet and separate them, spreading them out evenly. Transfer to oven and roast, without moving, for 20 minutes. Using a thin, flexible metal spatula to release any stuck potatoes, shake pan and turn potatoes. Continue roasting until potatoes are deep brown and crisp all over, turning and shaking them a few times during cooking, 30 to 40 minutes longer.
5. Transfer potatoes to a large bowl and add garlic/rosemary mixture and minced parsley. Toss to coat and season with more salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.

2. Cut the plantains into thick slices, you can make straight cuts or slightly diagonal cuts.
3. Heat the oil over medium high heat in a frying pan – use enough oil to almost cover the plantain slices - or a deep fryer, temperature should be about 350 F, fry the plantains until they start to get yellow, but not golden.
4. Remove the plantains and place on paper towels to drain the oil.
5. Use the bottom of a glass (or small bowl or a wood pestle) to smash and flatten the plantains, do this gently to keep the slices from breaking, a few cracks is ok as long as the whole slice remains in one piece. It is best to do this when they are still warm.
6. Sprinkle the plantain slices with salt and other seasonings (if using the raw garlic rub it on the slices).
7. Reheat the oil, temperature should be about 375 F and fry the plantains until golden on each side, about 1-2 minutes per side.
8. Remove from the oil, drain again on paper towels, and add additional seasoning if needed.

## Grilled Stuffed Mushrooms

### Ingredients

- 2 large Costco size containers of fresh mushrooms I used white
- 1 block of lite cream cheese
- 1 6 pack of Italian Sausage
- Grated Parmesan optional
- Salt & Pepper to taste

### Instructions

1. Prepare mushrooms by washing & breaking out the stems (Note....use the stems in pasta sauce or salad if you want).
2. Squeeze sausage out of casings & cook over medium high heat until browned and cooked through. I didn't drain mine because turkey sausage has little to drain. If using pork sausage, I would drain it. Add lite cream cheese and stir until melted.
3. Stuff mushrooms with cream cheese and sausage mixture. Sprinkle with parm, salt & pepper. Note that getting the parmesan to stick can be very fiddly (especially if you may have had a margarita before making these) so I skipped it after the first 3 or 4.
4. Preheat your bbq grill to around 375 go 400F. Place mushrooms on a griddle (we used our camping one) stuffing side up. Put in your bbq and close the lid. Keep an eye on them. The mushrooms are done when the tops are starting to brown and you can see a bit of liquid from the mushrooms. Don't over cook b/c they will get mushy.

## Mini Pumpkin Pies or 2 Pumpkin Pies

### Ingredients

- 2 Pie crusts from my 2 pie crust recipe (Apple pie recipe)
- 1 (15 oz) can pureed pumpkin 
- 2 eggs 
- 1 (14 oz) can sweetened condensed milk
- 1 Tbsp pumpkin pie spice 
- 1/4 tsp table salt
- Plus whipped cream for topping

### Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 425°F. Spray a 12-cup muffin tin with non-stick spray.
2. Cut as many 5 inch circles (either using a round cutter or a bowl or glass) as you can out of each pie crust, and fit them into each tin, crimping over the sides as necessary. Reroll the scraps if needed to get 12 crusts. 3. In a bowl or a 4 cup glass measuring cup (I used the measuring cup so I could pour it into each muffin tin directly without dirtying another bowl), whisk together the pumpkin, pumpkin pie spice, sweetened condensed milk, eggs and salt.
4. Pour the pumpkin mixture into each crust. Make sure not to fill completely to the top so that the pumpkin spills over the sides of the crust (if you’ve used a 5-inch cutter, you shouldn’t have that problem since the crust will be as tall as the muffin tin). 5. Bake at 425 for 15 minutes, then lower the heat to 350 and bake another 20-25 minutes until a knife inserted in the middle comes out clean. 6. Let the pies cool in the pan for at least 30 minutes, then pop them out. Top with whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon if desired.

## Sugar Cookies

### Ingredients

#### Cookies

- 2 cups (280 g) all-purpose gluten-free flour (I like “Grandpa’s Kitchen”)
- 1 teaspoon xanthan gum (omit if your blend already contains it)
- 3/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar
- 3 tablespoons (22 g) confectioners’ sugar
- 8 tablespoons (112 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1 egg (50 g, weighed out of shell) at room temperature, beaten
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- A few teaspoons of water if dough is too thick

#### Frosting

- 10 tablespoons (140 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 4 tablespoons milk, at room temperature
- 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
- 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
- 2 teaspoons meringue powder (LorAnn brand is gluten free)
- 4 cups (460 g) confectioners’ sugar
- Sprinkles (optional)

### Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F. Line rimmed baking sheets with unbleached parchment paper and set them aside.
2. In a large bowl, place the flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, salt, granulated sugar and confectioners’ sugar and whisk to combine well. Add the butter, egg, and vanilla, and mix to combine. The dough will be thick and relatively stiff, and you may need to add a little water and squeeze it together with your hands to bring all of it together.
3. Roll the dough between two sheets of unbleached parchment paper into a round a bit less than 1/3-inch thick. Using a 2 1/2-inch round cookie cutter, cut out rounds of dough and place them about 1-inch apart on the prepared baking sheets.
4. Place the baking sheet in the center of the preheated oven and bake until just set, about 6 to 8 minutes, depending upon size. The edges of some of the cookies may brown slightly. Take them out before there is any significant browning. Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool until set. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
5. While the cookies are cooling, make the frosting. In the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, place the butter, milk and vanilla, and mix on medium speed until combined. Turn the speed up to high and mix until creamy. Add the salt, meringue powder and about 3 1/2 cups of confectioners’ sugar. Mix slowly until the sugar is incorporated. Turn the mixer up to high and beat until it becomes uniformly thick. Add the rest of the confectioners’ sugar if necessary to thicken the frosting.
6. Once the cookies are completely cool, pipe or spoon a generous amount of frosting onto the top of each, and spread into an even layer with a wide knife or offset spatula. Scatter sprinkles, if desired. Allow to set at room temperature until the frosting hardens a bit. Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature.

\newpage

## Vanilla Cake

### Ingredients

- 2 cups (280 g) all purpose gluten free flour (I used Better Batter)
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 10 tablespoons (140 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1 teaspoon xanthan gum (omit if your blend already contains it)
- 1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons (54 g) cornstarch (or try arrowroot)*
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 1/2 cups (300 g) granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- 4 egg whites (100 g) + 1 whole egg (50 g, weighed out of shell), at room temperature**
- 1 1/3 cups (10 2/3 fluid ounces) Greek yogurt, at room temperature.

### Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F. Grease 2 8-inch round cake pans and line the bottom of each with a round of parchment paper (trace the perimeter of the cake pan on the parchment, then cut out the circle). Set the pans aside.

2. Into a medium-size bowl, sift (yes, you have to sift!) the flour, xanthan gum, cornstarch, baking soda and baking powder. Add the salt, and whisk to combine well. Set the dry ingredients aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or a large bowl with a handheld mixer, beat the butter, sugar and vanilla on medium-high speed for at least 3 minutes, stopping at least once to scrape the entire mixture off the sides and bottom of the bowl, or until very light and fluffy. Combine the egg whites, egg and buttermilk in a small bowl, and whisk to combine well. To the large bowl with the butter and sugar mixture, add the dry ingredients in 4 equal portions, alternating with the buttermilk and egg mixture in 3 parts, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients and mixing to combine in between additions. The batter will sometimes look a bit curdled. Once all of the ingredients have been added, beat for another minute on medium speed to ensure that everything is combined, then turn over the batter a few times by hand. It should be very thickly pourable and relatively smooth.

3. Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared baking pans and smooth each into an even layer with an offset spatula. Place the baking pans in the center of the preheated oven and bake for 20 minutes. Rotate the pans, and continue to bake until the cakes are lightly golden brown all over, have begun to pull away from the sides of the pan and do not jiggle in the center at all (about another 10 minutes). I find that these tests for doneness are more useful than the toothpick test.

4. Remove the cakes from the oven and allow to cool in the pans for 15 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack (and removing the parchment paper liners) to cool completely before frosting and serving. I frosted with 3 cups of a cream cheese buttercream frosting.

## Pie Crust

### Ingredients

#### One-Crust Pie (9 in.)

- 1 cup GF flour(with xanthum gum)
- 1/2 tsp. Salt
- 1/3 cup plus 1 Tbs shortening
- 2-3 Tbs cold water

#### Two-Crust Pie (9 in.)

- 2 cups GF flour (with xanthum gum)
- 1 tsp. Salt
- 2/3 Cup plus 2 Tbs shortening
- 4-5 Tbs cold water

### Instructions

1. Mix flour and salt in a medium bowl. Cut in shortening, using pastry blender or crisscrossing 2 knives, until particles are size of small peas. Sprinkle with cold water, 1 Tbs at a time, tossing with fork until all the flour is moistened and pastry almost leaves the side of the bowl (1-2 tsp. Of water can be added if needed).
2. Gather pastry into a ball. Shape into flattened round on lightly floured surface. (For Two-crust pie, divide pastry in half and shape into 2 rounds.)You can wrap up dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate about 30 min to firm up the shortening slightly, which helps make the baked pastry more flaky. 
3. Roll pastry in lightly floured surface, using floured pin, into circle 2 inches larger than upside-down pie plate. Fold pastry into fourths and place in pie plate; or roll pastry loosely around rolling pin and transfer to pie plate. Unfold or unroll pastry and ease onto plate, pressing firmly against bottom and side and being careful not to stretch pastry
4. For one-crust: To prevent pie crust from becoming soggy, partially bake pastry before adding filling. Heat oven to 425. Carefully line pastry with a double thickness of aluminum foil, gently pressing foil to bottom and side of pastry. Let foil extend over edge to prevent excessive browning. Bake 10 min and then carefully remove foil. Fill the pie and bake as directed in pie recipe.
5. For two-crust: Fill pie crust and place 2nd crust over the top (adding butter before if recipe calls for it). You can do fun things for the edge or make a lattice by cutting 1/2in strips and weaving them on the top. Bake as directed on the pie recipe.
